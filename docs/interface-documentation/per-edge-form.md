## Overview

[image 1]

The Per Alter Edge Form is an Interface that collects attribute data on the edges, or relationships, between nodes in a participant's network. When using the Per Alter Edge Form, participants review an introductory screen that describes the tasks on the stage and then complete a [form](../key-concepts/forms.md) for each edge they previously defined between pairs of alters within their network. These forms are customizable and can include one or multiple fields to collect specific edge attribute data.

#### Do

{: .good-practices}
- Use this Interface as a simple way to systematically collect data on edges. 
- Use the introductory panel to orient participants to the tasks within the form they will complete for each edge.
- Consider including form fields to capture temporal data which utilize [input controls](../key-concepts/input-controls.md) like the DatePicker.

#### Don't

{: .bad-practices}
- Avoid overloading this Interface with too many fields and/or text-heavy prompts. 
- Do not use this Interface in place of a dyad census as participants will only be asked to provide data on existing edges between alters rather than all possible alter combinations. If your study requires a [Dyad Census](add link) you can add and configure that Interface in Architect.
