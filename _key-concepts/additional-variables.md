title: Additional Variables


definition: The additional variables feature provides a way to automatically assign a the value of a variable when creating a node or edge.
---
"Additional variables" are defined on individual prompts in [Name Generator](../_interface-documentation/name-generator-using-forms.md) stages and automatically assigned to any entity that is active on that given prompt. These variables are optional, and can be used to keep track of where within an interview an entity was used, or to add to an element. Additional variables are boolean values, either "true" or "false". These variables can then be used in skip logic or filtering rules.

![Managing additional variables on a Name Generator prompt in Architect](../../assets/img/key-concepts/additional-variables/additional-variables.png){:standalone}

In Architect, on a Name Generator stage, you can add one or more additional variable to a prompt. You can create new variables or reuse other variables, and specify whether a prompt toggles the variable to "true" or "false".

In an interview, additional variables are toggled when nodes are added or removed from a prompt, with no required effort from the user.
