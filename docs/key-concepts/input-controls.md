Input controls provide a flexible way to collect variable values in [forms](../forms). Below you will find a summary of each available input control, and advice about when to use them.

## <a name="Checkbox-Group "></a>Checkbox Group

![image](/assets/img/key-concepts/input-controls/CheckboxGroup.png)

{: .no_toc}
### Purpose

The checkbox group is designed to provide a familiar interface for selecting one or more items from a (non-hierarchical) range of options.

Options are displayed vertically, to allow for longer labels and to create a more scannable list.

{: .no_toc}
### Do

{: .good-practices}
- You can select multiple items in one control. 
- Check that the options are not too long or text wrapping might be an issue. 

{: .no_toc}
### Don't

{: .bad-practices}
- Long checkbox groups are often hard to see on a screen. Consider using 8 or fewer options generally speaking. 
- Check boxes provide an 'implied no' meaning that if people do not check the box this _implies_ that it does not apply to them. But if you need explicit confirmation try a different control with a true/false value per option.

## <a name="Date-Picker"></a>Date Picker

![image](/assets/img/key-concepts/input-controls/DatePicker.png)

{: .no_toc}
### Purpose

A date picker is used to select a date based on the current calendar. Generally date pickers select a day but you can also set it to be less granular, thereby allowing participants to select a month or simply a year. 

{: .no_toc}
### Do

{: .good-practices}
- Start on today's date. 
- Selecting a date from the current month is obvious. However, participants might not know how to select a month or year in the past easily. Consider a tip, instruction, or web video to help show them. 

{: .no_toc}
### Don't

{: .bad-practices}
- Generally participants find it difficult to provide precise dates, such as the specific date of first sexual contact. You may want to allow people to be less granular by for example letting them set a month rather than date.

## <a name="Likert-Scale"></a>Likert Scale

![image](/assets/img/key-concepts/input-controls/LikertScale.png)

{: .no_toc}
### Purpose

A Likert scale is a control to allow participants to select from an ordered series of options. Likert scales are widely used in psychometric research. Typically they have five ordered categories, much like "Strongly disagree", "Disagree", "Neither agree nor disagree", "Agree", and "Strongly Agree". You can select the number and value of the response categories to suit your needs. 

{: .no_toc}
### Do

{: .good-practices}
- Consider whether you want to provide a middle choice or not and mark it as neutral/ambivalent (e.g., "neither agree nor disagree" rather than unsure.  
- Consider whether you need more than five categories. Much research suggests there's limited power in using seven or more categories rather than just 5 (or even 3, xx.ref)

{: .no_toc}
### Don't

{: .bad-practices}
- Put the response cateogires out of order.
