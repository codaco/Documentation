Pairing is the process which enables secure communication between an Interviewer client and Server. If you have paired devices before using Bluetooth, you can think about pairing in Network Canvas as a similar process - one device initiates pairing by exchanging a password with another device in order to establish a trusted connection through which information can be shared. For further information on the technical implementation, see our [security model](../../security-model) documentation.

Pairing is necessary for Interviewer clients to both retrieve information from Server (e.g. the protocol file) and transmit information back to Server automatically (e.g. send interview data without exporting the file from Interviewer and importing it into Server).
