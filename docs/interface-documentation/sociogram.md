## Overview

Sociograms are the visual mapping component of a network interview. On the Sociogram, participants draw ties between alters to signify the relationships between individuals within their personal network.

There are two sociogram Interfaces in Network Canvas - one for data collection and one for data display - that can be added to your study and configured in Architect.

## Sociogram

When using the "Sociogram" Interface, participants position their alters and draw ties between them. The Interface can be used to create one or multiple edge types between alters in a participant's network, and to collect alter attribute data by highlighting alters where the variable value is true.

#### Do

{: .good-practices}
- Consider customizing the background image of the sociogram to orient participants to the activity or to add meaning to the layout variable (e.g. such as using quadrants). 
- Ensure that the prompts used on this Interface are edge creation prompts - questions about the relationships between alters. 

{: .no_toc}
#### Don't

{: .bad-practices}
- Nodes positioned too close together may visually occlude one another or the edge between them. Caution participants not to place nodes directly on top of one another.
