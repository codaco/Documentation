Welcome to our documentation portal, and thank you for your interest in the Network Canvas project.

We hope that over the coming weeks and months this website will develop into a one-stop resource for any and all information relating to using this software. Producing documentation is a top priority for our team, but it will take us some time to cover everything. If you spot a gap in our documentation, or have a question, please feel free to contact us. In the meantime, thank you for your patience!

Some initial pages that might be useful are:

- Our FAQ (coming soon)
- [The installation guide for the software](./docs/installation-guide.md)
- [The project overview](./docs/project-overview.md)
- [Citing the software](./docs/citing-the-software.md)

## Search function

We encourage you to use the search function to find articles on any given topic. Our pages are heavily interlinked, and information is necessarily spread around.

## Structure of this site

Please explore the pages and headings to the left. Aside from some top-level pages (such as the Project Overview and the Installation Guide), the bulk of our documentation is under the following headings:

- **[Tutorials](./docs/tutorials/index.md)** - where you will find in-depth articles that take you through the most fundamental tasks you can accomplish with the software, such as building a protocol, running it in network canvas, and exporting data.
- **[Key Concepts](./docs/key-concepts/index.md)** - which has self-contained articles on all the fundamental concepts within the Network Canvas software.
- **Interface Documentation (coming soon)** - if you are looking for specific information about the configuration options of an interface, this section contains a page dedicated to each type.
- **[Technical Documentation](./docs/technical-documentation/index.md)** - if you have more advanced technical questions, such as about the security implementation, or how to develop your own custom functionality within Network Canvas, this section provides articles on a variety of technical topics.

Away from these sections, we have also created a section to help with the practical aspects of conducting a study using the Network Canvas software. The [Research Design] section covers:

- Choosing hardware for conducting a Network Canvas study (coming soon)
- [Configuring your devices prior to starting data collection](./docs/research-design/configuring-devices)
- Best practices for security and IRB submission
