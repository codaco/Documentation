## Overview

The Information Interface is a general purpose screen that can be used to present information to participants using a variety of text and media resources. For example, this screen can be useful to introduce a study or to provide instructions or context for a particular stage in the survey.

When using the Information Interface, you can incorporate one or multiple [resources](../key-concepts/resources.md) by either retrieving files from your resource library in Architect or locally from your device. No more than four items can be used at one time.
