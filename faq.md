## What is the Network Canvas suite of tools?

The Network Canvas suite consists of three applications designed to assist researchers in the collection of social network data. These applications are: Architect for building Network Canvas interview protocols, Network Canvas for use in the field to collect data, and Server for managing data.

We have designed our software to overcome a few distinct barriers to social network data collection:

1. The act of collecting self-reported data is often dull and tedious. Our software is built with an emphasis on user experience, and has been rated highly in usability and satisfaction [testing](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858368).
2. There is not enough consistency or capacity for reproducibility across social network data collection. Having reusable, road-tested, and easy to implement instruments in our Architect software should help researchers to begin to standardize and improve the quality and impact of their research.
3. Managing incoming network data and preparing it for statistical analysis is too difficult. Our Server app will securely store and export data in formats that work with most common social network analysis applications and workflows.

## When can I use the tools in the Network Canvas suite?

Network Canvas is currently in the beta phase of development. The software is feature complete and available for testing and evaluation by the research community, but may still contain bugs and, therefore, is not yet advisable for use in a live research study. During the public beta period, we invite researchers to test the software, design research instruments, provide feedback, and begin planning the implementation of Network Canvas in future studies.

The first full stable release of the suite is expected in Summer 2020.  

Download the beta versions of Architect, Network Canvas, and Server directly from our [website](http://www.networkcanvas.com). To stay current with our progress and scheduled outreach activities, [subscribe to our mailing list](http://networkcanvas.com/#feedback).

## How much will the Network Canvas suite cost?

The Network Canvas suite is free and open source. The project team has a strong ideological commitment to producing high quality free academic software for the benefit of researchers, students, and any other interested parties.

It is our intention to foster a community to support the ongoing development of these tools, and we welcome collaboration. Please visit our [github](https://github.com/complexdatacollective) page to explore options for contributing to development.

## Who is developing the Network Canvas suite?

The suite is being developed by a team of researchers and developers based at Northwestern University and the University of Oxford, as well as several external contracted developers.

We are grateful to be funded through a grant from the [National Institute of Health](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9306043&icde=35540823&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=).

## I don’t have any technical knowledge. Can I still use the Network Canvas suite?

Our tools are designed to be used by all social network researchers, regardless of technical expertise. Our goal is to make the software usable for anyone who has everyday computing knowledge, such as would be required to use a laptop or iPad.

The Network Canvas suite provides an end-to-end workflow, taking you from designing your interview to collating and exporting the data in a format that you are used to working with. Our central aim is to simplify this process, and lower the technical barriers to conducting personal networks research. 

Finally, we intend to run demonstrations and training sessions at many network analysis conferences in the near future. In addition, our website will be a hub for training material, including videos and documentation. We hope you find these useful. If not, please let us know and we will try to improve as best we can.

## My participants have special language or literacy requirements. Can I still use Network Canvas?

Network Canvas has technologies built in to allow research with mixed/low written literacy groups, and we welcome discussion about ways we can adapt the software to new research populations. Please visit our feedback forum if you have something to contribute to help us improve.

## Which hardware do I need to run the different components of the Network Canvas suite?

The Network Canvas suite consists of three applications, with each component running on a variety of platforms:

* Architect and Server are desktop apps, and will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
* Network Canvas is a hybrid desktop/mobile app, and will run on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. It will work best with a touch screen device, but will also function well with a conventional computer that uses a keyboard and mouse. Specific functionality may vary by operating system.

Our development test devices have included Samsung Chromebook Plus, the iPad Pro, and the Google Pixel C tablet. We have also completed Network Canvas studies using 27 inch “all in one” touchscreen computers with very positive results. Although Network Canvas has not been tested rigorously on the newest models on the market, we anticipate that most mid to high-end laptop computers and tablets will be capable of running the software well. If you are planning data collection with a device not listed above and have specific questions, please [contact us](mailto:info@networkcanvas.com) directly.

## How do I cite the Network Canvas suite of tools in a paper or grant application?

In the future, we will have a technical paper for the whole Network Canvas suite. Until then, please cite the following paper:

Hogan, B., Melville, J., Phillips II, G., Janulis, P., Contractor, N., Mustanski, B., & Birkett, M. (2016). Evaluating the Paper-to-Screen Translation of Participant-Aided Sociograms with High-Risk Participants. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Human Factors in Computing. CHI ’16. (pp. 5360–5371).

## Does the software support feature X?

Perhaps! As our work progresses, we encourage interested parties to browse the documentation and tutorials that will be available through this website, and to download our public beta versions of the software now available.

More importantly, we also encourage researchers to get involved in shaping our development by contacting us directly with your proposed changes and suggested functionality. We depend on good ideas from the community to make our tool the best it can be!

Finally, the software suite has been built to allow extensibility by technically minded individuals. Please [get in touch](mailto:info@networkcanvas.com) if you wish to commission specific functionality for your study.

## My research involves sensitive data. What security features does the Network Canvas suite have to keep my data secure?

Our software was born in the context of research of a highly sensitive nature, so we understand that for many researchers security is of the utmost importance.

We do not transmit, collect or retain any data from or about your study. The data you collect in the field is yours, and is only ever stored on your devices.

If you wish to utilize our remote transfer functionality, we use end-to-end encryption to ensure that your data cannot be intercepted by a third party as it is sent remotely back to your laboratory or department computer.

This transfer can take place on a local network within your institution, for added security.

If you have specific security requirements, please contact us to discuss how we can make our software suite compliant with your needs.
