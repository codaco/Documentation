## Overview

{% include nc-image src="/assets/img/interface-documentation/ego-form/egoform-example.png" %}

The Ego Form is an interface that collects data on your participant (ego). When using the Ego Form, participants complete a [form](../key-concepts/forms.md) about themselves that consists of one or more fields. This Interface also contains an embedded introductory panel where the purpose of the form can be described to a participant. 

## Configuring Ego Form

The configurable [form](../key-concepts/forms.md) determines which [variables](../key-concepts/variable-types.md) will be assigned to the participant.
