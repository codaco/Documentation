## Overview
  
[image 1]

The Categorical Bin is a name interpreter Interface that collects nominal data on the alters in a participant's network. When using the Categorical Bin, participants drag and drop alters one-by-one into colorful circles which each represent a category of the categorical variable. Once placed, participants can tap on any category and move alters within that category to any other.

#### Do

{: .good-practices}
- Use this Interface to collect nominal data on alters. Although a Toggle Button Group can be added as an [input control](../key-concepts/input-control.md) on other interfaces, the drag and drop functionality on the Categorical Bin provides a tactile method to capturing these data that is engaging for participants.

#### Don't

{: .bad-practices}
- Avoid using more than eight categories on this Interface. More categories cause the category labels to be difficult to read and the other visual compromises on the Interface become compromised. 
- Avoid using the Categorical Bin to capture dichotomous variables. Dichotomous variables are best captured using the Toggle [input control](../key-concepts/input-control.md) (on a [Name Generator](./name-generator.md) or [Per Alter Form](./per-alter-form.md)) or using the variable toggling feature on the [Sociogram](./sociogram.md).
