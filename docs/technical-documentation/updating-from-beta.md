## Summary

We are excited to announce the release of the stable versions of the three apps in the Network Canvas Suite. This software is the product of the wonderful support we have received from testers and colleagues - so please accept a sincere 'thank you' from the Network Canvas project team!

If you are currently using beta versions of our software, you may have seen a notice informing you that it is no longer supported. Going forward, we will only be providing support and updates for the stable versions of our software. This is because we made several important changes that cannot easily be back-ported.

In order to avoid inconveniencing our users, we made the decision to keep the existing software unchanged, so that you can continue to use it while you need it.

**IMPORTANT: it will not be possible to migrate existing data from Server or Network Canvas to the new versions.**

Because of this, you should export all the data you require from both Server and Network Canvas before uninstalling the beta versions, and installing the stable versions. Protocols you have authored in Architect can be automatically upgraded by the stable version of Architect.

## Update process

1. When you are **absolutely certain** that you have exported all data you require from Network Canvas and Server, and you have your protocol files saved to a location you can remember, please uninstall the existing applications. Windows users who do not know how to uninstall software should consult this [Microsoft support article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4028054/windows-10-repair-or-remove-programs). MacOS users can find the same information in [this Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202235). For iPadOS users, information on removing apps can be [found here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207618), and  Android users can find information for their devices [on this page](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2521768).
2. Visit the [download page](https://networkcanvas.com/download.html) to download the installation packages for the stable version of the software.
3. (Optional) If you want to continue using a protocol file you have already authored, open it in the stable release of Architect, and it will be automatically upgraded to be compatible with the stable versions of Network Canvas and Server. You may then install it on your Network Canvas device.
4. (Optional) You can then also use your upgraded protocol in Server, as with previous versions. You will need to re-pair any Network Canvas client devices you wish to use.

## Troubleshooting
